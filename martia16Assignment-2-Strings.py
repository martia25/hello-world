#This is kind of tricky..

#You will update/modify the program below to complete the following
# ask a user to enter their first name and store it in a variable
# ask a user to enter their last name and store it in a variable
# ask the user how many cups of coffee that they have had today
# ask the user how many cups of coffee that they had yesterday
#calculate the total number of cups of coffee by adding the 2 numbers together

# print out hello followed by their full name you have drank XX cups of coffee in the last two days!!!

# Make sure you have that your sentence is formatted correctly with appropriate number of spaces
# Make sure the first letter of first name and last name is uppercase
# Make sure the rest of the name is lowercase
###############################################################################################
#The program below is close but will require some modfication

first_name = input('What is your first name?')
last_name = input('what is your last name?')

coffe_today = input('How many cups of coffee did you drink today?')
coffee_yesterday = input('How many cups of coffee did you drink today?')

total_coffee = int(coffe_today) + int(coffee_yesterday)

print("Hello " + first_name.capitalize() + ' ' + last_name.capitalize() + " you drank " + str(total_coffee) + " cups of coffee!!!")
